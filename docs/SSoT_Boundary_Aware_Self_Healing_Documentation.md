# Boundary-Aware Self-Healing System Documentation

## Overview

The Boundary-Aware Self-Healing System is a production-ready solution designed to maintain perfect 1-1 synchronization between the SSoT database and broker data. This system operates strictly within the constraints of available broker data boundaries, ensuring that healing operations are both safe and effective.

## Core Concept: Broker Data Boundaries

### The Problem
Traditional self-healing systems often attempt to heal data gaps without considering whether the broker actually has that data available. This leads to:
- Failed healing attempts for data that doesn't exist
- Wasted processing power on impossible operations
- Inconsistent database states
- False positive gap detections

### The Solution: Boundary-Constrained Healing
Our system first establishes the exact boundaries of available broker data, then operates exclusively within those boundaries:

```
Broker Data Window: [First Available] ←────────────→ [Last Available]
                           ↓                              ↓
Our Healing Window:   [Boundary Start] ←──────────→ [Boundary End]
                           ↑                              ↑
                    Only heal within this range
```

## System Architecture

### 1. BrokerDataBoundaryManager.mqh
**Purpose**: Detect and manage broker data availability boundaries

**Key Features**:
- Discovers the earliest and latest available data from the broker
- Tracks boundaries for multiple symbol/timeframe combinations
- Validates that healing targets are within broker boundaries
- Provides boundary constraint validation for all healing operations

**Core Methods**:
```cpp
bool RegisterSymbolTimeframe(const string symbol, ENUM_TIMEFRAMES tf)
bool UpdateBoundaries(const string symbol, ENUM_TIMEFRAMES tf)
bool IsCompletelyInSync(const string symbol, ENUM_TIMEFRAMES tf)
double GetSyncPercentage(const string symbol, ENUM_TIMEFRAMES tf)
```

**Boundary Detection Process**:
1. Query broker for maximum historical data to find earliest available timestamp
2. Get current/latest available timestamp from broker
3. Calculate total available bars within the boundary window
4. Compare with database content to determine sync status

### 2. BoundaryAwareGapDetector.mqh
**Purpose**: Detect data gaps only within validated broker boundaries

**Key Features**:
- Scans for gaps exclusively within broker data boundaries
- Validates that detected gaps can actually be healed
- Prioritizes gaps based on healing feasibility and importance
- Excludes market closure periods (weekends, holidays) from gap detection

**Gap Detection Algorithm**:
```cpp
// For each symbol/timeframe:
1. Get broker boundaries from BoundaryManager
2. Query database for all timestamps within boundaries
3. Calculate expected timestamps based on timeframe intervals
4. Identify missing timestamps as gaps
5. Validate gaps against broker data availability
6. Mark gaps as healable or non-healable
```

**Gap Prioritization**:
- Higher priority: Shorter timeframes (M1 > M5 > M15 > H1)
- Higher priority: Smaller gaps (fewer missing bars)
- Higher priority: Recent gaps (within last 24 hours)
- Only healable gaps within boundaries are considered

### 3. BoundaryConstrainedHealer.mqh
**Purpose**: Heal gaps with strict boundary validation

**Key Features**:
- Validates all healing operations against broker boundaries
- Fetches data directly from broker using CopyRates()
- Inserts data with conflict resolution (INSERT OR REPLACE)
- Verifies healing success through post-operation validation
- Maintains detailed healing operation history

**Healing Process**:
```cpp
// For each gap to heal:
1. Validate gap is within broker boundaries
2. Perform safety checks (rate limiting, system health)
3. Fetch data from broker using CopyRates()
4. Filter out invalid timestamps (weekends, holidays)
5. Insert data into database with conflict resolution
6. Verify healing success by counting inserted bars
7. Record operation results for statistics
```

**Safety Mechanisms**:
- Rate limiting (minimum 5 seconds between operations)
- Boundary validation before every operation
- Data integrity checks after insertion
- Rollback capability for failed operations

### 4. BoundaryAwareSelfHealingSystem.mqh
**Purpose**: Orchestrate all components into a cohesive system

**Key Features**:
- Manages lifecycle of all boundary-aware components
- Provides automated healing cycles with configurable intervals
- Tracks comprehensive system statistics
- Supports both automated and manual healing operations
- Generates detailed system reports

**System Workflow**:
```cpp
Initialization:
1. Initialize BoundaryManager with database handle
2. Initialize GapDetector with BoundaryManager reference
3. Initialize Healer with both previous components
4. Register all symbol/timeframe pairs for tracking

Full System Scan:
1. Detect boundaries for all tracked symbols
2. Detect gaps within those boundaries
3. Heal high-priority gaps (if auto-healing enabled)
4. Validate healing results and update statistics

Incremental Healing (Automated):
1. Quick gap detection for new gaps
2. Heal up to max_gaps_per_cycle
3. Update statistics
4. Schedule next cycle
```

## Integration with SSoT EA

### Simple Integration Example
```cpp
// In SSoT.mq5 OnInit():
CBoundaryAwareSelfHealingSystem* g_boundary_healer = NULL;

// Initialize
g_boundary_healer = new CBoundaryAwareSelfHealingSystem();
g_boundary_healer.Initialize(g_main_db);

// Register symbols
g_boundary_healer.RegisterSymbolTimeframe("EURUSD", PERIOD_M1);
g_boundary_healer.RegisterSymbolTimeframe("EURUSD", PERIOD_M5);
g_boundary_healer.RegisterSymbolTimeframe("EURUSD", PERIOD_H1);

// Start system
g_boundary_healer.Start();

// In SSoT.mq5 OnTimer():
g_boundary_healer.ProcessAutoHealing();

// In SSoT.mq5 OnDeinit():
delete g_boundary_healer;
```

### Configuration Options
```cpp
// Enable/disable automated healing
g_boundary_healer.EnableAutoHealing(true);

// Set scan interval (seconds)
g_boundary_healer.SetScanInterval(600); // 10 minutes

// Set maximum gaps to heal per cycle
g_boundary_healer.SetMaxGapsPerCycle(5);

// Enable aggressive mode (more gaps per cycle)
g_boundary_healer.SetAggressiveMode(false);
```

### Manual Control Methods
```cpp
// Trigger manual operations
g_boundary_healer.TriggerManualBoundaryDetection();
g_boundary_healer.TriggerManualGapDetection();
g_boundary_healer.TriggerManualHealing();

// Emergency operations
g_boundary_healer.PerformEmergencySync();
g_boundary_healer.ForceCompleteResync("EURUSD", PERIOD_M1);

// Get status and reports
string status = g_boundary_healer.GenerateQuickStatus();
string report = g_boundary_healer.GenerateSystemReport();
SBoundaryHealingStats stats = g_boundary_healer.GetStatistics();
```

### Optimization Recommendations
1. **Start with major pairs and shorter timeframes** (M1, M5, M15)
2. **Use incremental healing** rather than full scans during trading hours
3. **Perform full scans during market closure** for minimal impact
4. **Monitor sync percentages** and focus on symbols with lowest sync rates
5. **Use aggressive mode sparingly** to avoid overwhelming the broker connection

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Boundary detection fails
- **Cause**: Symbol not available or connection issues
- **Solution**: Verify symbol availability with SymbolSelect(), check broker connection

**Issue**: Gap detection finds no gaps but sync percentage is low
- **Cause**: Data exists but outside detected boundaries
- **Solution**: Force boundary re-detection, check broker historical data limits

**Issue**: Healing operations fail
- **Cause**: Rate limiting or database lock
- **Solution**: Increase scan intervals, check database accessibility

**Issue**: Sync percentage not improving
- **Cause**: Gaps outside broker boundaries or non-healable gaps
- **Solution**: Review gap report, focus on healable gaps only
