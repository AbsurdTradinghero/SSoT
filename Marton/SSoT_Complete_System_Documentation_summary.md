# Summary: SSoT_Complete_System_Documentation.md

This document is the comprehensive v5.0 engineering reference for the SSoT Chain-of-Trust System:

- **Executive Summary**: Enterprise-grade framework mirroring broker data with cryptographic, blockchain-inspired validation.
- **Three Pillars of Integrity**: Smart Data Acquisition (historical backfill + real-time acquisition), Blockchain-Inspired Validation (dual flags for content and chain), Autonomous Self-Healing (gap detection + targeted backfill).
- **Project Structure**: Layout of source, MT5 binaries, Experts, Include libraries (Core, Testing), build scripts, and databases.
- **Control Panel (Gold Standard)**: `TestPanel_Simple.mqh` and visual/test interfaces for live and test modes.
- **3-Tier Test Environment**: Main production DB, test input DB, and test output DB with controlled flow and validation steps.
- **Main Orchestrator EA**: Lean MQL5 orchestrator (`SSoT.mq5`) handles multi-database connections, test panel integration, configuration parameters, and event-driven monitoring.
- **Validation Mechanisms**: Detailed explanation of `is_validated` and `is_complete` logic, cascade invalidation, and recovery processes.
